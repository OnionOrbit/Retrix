Retrix is an independent community fork of the Modrinth Monorepo, focused on a simpler feature set and offline account support.

Important: Retrix is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Modrinth or Modrinth LLC. It is an unofficial fork intended for personal and community use.

### What’s different from upstream
-   Added: Offline account feature.
-   Removed: Skins and Friends features.
-   Changed: Default theme color to blue.
-   Branding status: Some Modrinth branding may still exist from the upstream UI; this is planned to be replaced. Retrix is not an official Modrinth product.
